Practice Helper is a way to allow singers and musicians to practice musical pieces at their own pace when unable to work with an accompanist.
The way it works is simple: Press the space bar on every beat, so that you become your own conductor.  
At any point in the music, you can slow down or speed up the music by decreasing or increasing the rate of pressing the spacebar.
Have a part that's troubling you?  Slow down that section so that you can really work through it.
Or conversely, if there's a certain section that you don't need more practice on, speed through it, so you can get to the important parts.
To start, you must upload a MuseScore file as a .musicxml file.  You can either convert any of your own MuseScore files, or use any of the samples in the "MuseScoreFiles" folder.
Enjoy!
